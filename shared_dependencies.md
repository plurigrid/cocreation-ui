Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files we are generating could include:

1. **API Keys**: Both `llama_index.py` and `fastapi_poe.py` will need to use the API keys for the llama_index and Poe API respectively.

2. **Data Schemas**: Both `llama_index.py` and `fastapi_poe.py` will likely share some data schemas if they are exchanging data. These could be in the form of JSON schemas or database schemas.

3. **Function Names**: Functions for making API calls, processing data, and handling errors could be shared across the files. For example, `get_data_from_llama_index()`, `get_data_from_poe_api()`, `process_data()`, `handle_error()`.

4. **Variable Names**: Variables for storing data, API keys, and other configuration settings could be shared across the files. For example, `llama_index_api_key`, `poe_api_key`, `data`, `config`.

5. **Message Names**: If the integration involves messaging or event-driven architecture, there could be shared message names or event names. For example, `llama_index_data_received`, `poe_api_data_received`.

6. **Imported Libraries**: Both `llama_index.py` and `fastapi_poe.py` will likely need to import the same libraries for making HTTP requests, handling JSON data, etc. For example, `requests`, `json`.

7. **Main.py**: This file will likely import and use functions and variables from both `llama_index.py` and `fastapi_poe.py`, making it dependent on the other two files.
